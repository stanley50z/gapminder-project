# Data Selection
In response to the recent COVID pandemic, many people protest about governments asking people to get vaccines. I chose 5 datasets about population, child mortality rate, and pecentage of parent who think vaccines are not safe, effective, or important.

# Data Processing
To fit into one graph, the dataset of population is scaled down, the other four datasets are scaled up.

# Conclusion
I found that the anti-vaccine rate is not generally related to the population. For most countries with population more than 10M and less than 100M, the anti-vaccine rate is moderately related to the child mortality. Parents are generally more concerned with vaccine being unsafe, then being ineffective, then being not important. Parents are generally more concerned with vaccines when their countries have higher child mortality rate, with one great outlier being France, which has the greatest rate of concerning parents but a very low child mortality rate.
